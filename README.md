# Warning App

[Amtliche Warnungen](https://warnung.bund.de/) offers an API where different warnings can be obtained for the different Apps like NINA or Katwarn.

## Your Task

Create a simple android application that shows the current warnings from their public API.

Use the API based on the Open API Schema located at [bund.dev](https://nina.api.bund.dev/) and check out the different warning channels like: Katwarn, Biwapp, Mowas or from the German Weather Service (DWD). Show the warnings within the app.

Use a non-proprietary common tech stack (preferably Kotlin) and explain in a readme how to run your solution. Please use version control (git is preferred).

### Considerations

- we suggest to make use of Jetpack compose for declarative UI development
- we make us of Okhttp
- bonus: more than only one type of testing strategy (Unit + UI Test)

## Submitting your solution

Please submit your solution at least 2-3 days before your technical interview. You have two options:

1.  Hosted repository (preferred)

Please email a link to a GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab/etc. repo toÂ [challenge@digitalservice.bund.de](mailto:challenge@digitalservice.bund.de). Make sure to make the repo private 3 days after the interview.

2.  Email

Alternatively, you can email your solution as a zip file toÂ [challenge@digitalservice.bund.de](mailto:challenge@digitalservice.bund.de). Make sure to include the commit history in your submission.

## Evaluation

We want to use this challenge to understand how you would approach such a problem in a work setting.

Among other things, we pay attention to:

- how you structure your application and your source code,
- how you name variables/functions/classes/packages,
- how you test your application and what kinds of tests you're writing,
- how you document your application, including instructions to run the project,
- what your commits look like,
- whether you know how to consume APIs efficiently,
- what tooling you use,
- overall consistency & attention to detail.

You should turn in a complete and runnable solution, but do not gold-plate it: we don't expect you to spend more than a few hours (2-3 hrs) on this exercise.

In the technical interview that follows we would like to discuss your approach, and that includes talking about areas you would want to improve if given more time.

Note that the UI won't be part of the evaluation (could be plain HTML for instance).

## Have fun!Â ðŸš€

We look forward to your submission! PleaseÂ [let us know](mailto:challenge@digitalservice.bund.de)Â if you have any questions or concerns.
